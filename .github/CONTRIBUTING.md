# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for your interest in my project.

Although this is my personal work and I develop it just for fun, bug reports (including typos) or suggestions (e.g. new features) are always appreciated.

Questions about implementation or documentation are also welcome, as your comments will definitely improve the quality of the project.

Please do not hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/NaokiHori/SimpleNSSolver/issues/new), or [write to me](https://github.com/NaokiHori).

Naoki Hori
