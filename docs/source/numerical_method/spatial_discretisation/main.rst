Spatial discretisation
######################

In this section, spatial treatments are extensively discussed.

* :ref:`Domain setup <domain_setup>`

   How variables (coordinates, velocities, pressure, and temperature) are located in the computational domain is described.
   Also domain decomposition technique to parallelise the whole procedure is considered.

* :ref:`Discrete governing equations <discrete_governing_equations>`

   How :ref:`the governing equations <governing_equations>` should be discretised is presented.
   In particular, how the original properties in the continuous space is kept after being discretised is focused.
