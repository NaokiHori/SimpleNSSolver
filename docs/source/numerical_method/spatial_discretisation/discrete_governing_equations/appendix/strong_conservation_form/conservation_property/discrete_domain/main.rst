Discrete domain

.. note::

   Throughout the project, I assume that the :math:`x` direction is the wall-normal direction and the grid sizes can vary, while :math:`y` direction is the homogeneous direction and the grid space is uniform.
   For generality, however, I take into account the grid size variations also in :math:`y` direction in the following discussion.

The discrete governing equations in the strong conservation forms are discussed here.
In addition, the quadratic quantities and the energy balance relations are discussed.
