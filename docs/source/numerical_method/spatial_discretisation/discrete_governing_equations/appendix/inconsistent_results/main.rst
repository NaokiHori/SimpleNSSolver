Inconsistent results

In :ref:`the previous part <discrete_governing_equations>`, I extensively discuss a scheme to satisfy the following properties:

   * The advective terms conserve the discrete momenta and the quadratic quantities.

   * The diffusive terms dissipate the transported quantities properly.

One might be tempted to know whether these rigorous formulations are really necessary.
In this part, I try to answer this question by comparing with another intuitive discretisation.
