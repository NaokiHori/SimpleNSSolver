Under the Boussinesq approximation, in the momentum balance, I have

.. math::

   \dintrpu{T}{x}

in the :math:`x` direction.

As a result, in the kinetic energy balance, I have

.. math::

   \ux \dintrpu{T}{x}.

At this moment, I do not have enough information to replace :ref:`the placeholder <basic_operators_interpolation>`, which will be given later.
